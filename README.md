## Bee-Snake Project
It is a game similar to a regular snake, but instead of a snake we have a bee collecting nectar.

## Guidelines:
1. An mp3 folder was created in the project that is not in the repository. So if you want to have music while playing and when you lose it. You need to create an mp3 folder and add songs in ```.wav``` format.
Then change title song in the method:
```java
public static String playRandomSound();
```
